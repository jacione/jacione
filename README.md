- 👋 Hi, I'm Nick Porter (@jacione). 
- 👨‍🎓 I'm currently working toward a master's degree in physics at Brigham Young University. 
- 👀 I’m interested in coherent diffraction imaging, algorithm development, device interfacing, experimental automation, and Star Wars.
- ⌨ I'm pretty good with Python, with a vague grasp of C, C++, Javascript, and a few other languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about GPU-accelerated computing.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on pretty much anything.
