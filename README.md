- 👋 Hi, I'm Nick Porter (@jacione). 
- 👨‍🎓 I'm currently working toward a master's degree in physics at Brigham Young University. 
- 👀 I’m interested in optical propagation, coherent imaging, ptychography, device interfacing, experimental automation, and Star Wars.
- ⌨ I'm fairly good with Python, with a vague grasp of C, C++, Javascript, and a few other languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make Python documentation with Sphinx.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on pretty much anything.
- 📫 How to reach me: through GitHub.
